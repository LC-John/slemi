# Welcome!
Here we provide data and information required to reproduce the runtime analysis plot and the Simulink models used to reproduce bugs.

## Bugs

[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kuJUuydsbjEO6zR-sWlW7diEAxYaqwLI?usp=sharing) the Simulink models we had used to report bugs.

## Recreate Runtime Plots

First, please see installation and requirments from the [homepage](../../Readme.md). Then:

- Copy the `.mat` files from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ExFqmPXZrZcTYo6a65-xZqLJQve-PGV1) to the `workdata` folder
- Run `covexp.addpaths(); covexp.r.scaling()` in a MATLAB prompt
